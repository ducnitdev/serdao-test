Implement:
- Separate: UserController, UserService, User Repository, User (Entity).
- Handle validation: First Name, Last Name, Address.
- Add CSRF token, handle for security.
- Add popup confirm when delete user.
- Change method delete user From Get to Post.
- User Entity: FirstName, Last Name, Address. (separate field data)
- If I have so much time, I will implement PHP unitest for this
